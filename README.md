# Primary ICT Support - Builder Addons for Themify
Here is a Plugin for WordPress that extends the Themify Builder to add some features.

## Sub Page Menu
This module will add the ability to add sub pages to a web page as a block that will show an icon or a featured image of the page.

Also you can display the menu as a list, this list will fall back based on the pages children and then to a selected menu in the options.

## PDF Viewer.
This module will give you the option to include a PDF and display it using PDF.js.
#### TODO
- PDF.js doens't allow me to add more than 1 PDF viewer module on the page.
- PDF.js breaks when used in conjunction with Dflip Plugin
